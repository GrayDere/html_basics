            <p>
                The first four stories were collected, along with a new introductory story, and published by Gnome Press in 1951 as Foundation. <p>
                The later stories were published in pairs by Gnome as <em>Foundation and Empire (1952)</em> and <em>Foundation (1953)</em>, 
                resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.</p>
            </strong>

            <p>The early stories were inspired by Edward Gibbon's <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>.<p>
                The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the "decline and fall of the Galactic Empire."<p> 
                The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in science fiction fandom, 
                associated with the Futurians, known as Michelism.<hr>
            </p>

            <p>The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent.<p> 
                Although many science fiction novels such as Nineteen Eighty-Four or Fahrenheit 451 do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition and they act as a moral allegory of the modern world.</p>
                <p>The Foundation series, on the other hand,
                 looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time.
                </p>

                <p> Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization. </p>
                <p>
                    Here is the list of the Foundation Books in chronological order:

                    Interestingly a number of cultural impacts were a result of the Foundation novels over a course of many decades.

                                <p>Stating that it "offers a useful summary of some of the dynamics of far-flung imperial Rome", Carl Sagan in 1978 listed the Foundation series as an example of how science fiction "can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader".[24] </p>
                                <li>In the nonfiction PBS series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Sagan referred to an Encyclopedia Galactica in the episodes "Encyclopaedia Galactica" and "Who Speaks for Earth".</p>

                                    In 1966, the Foundation trilogy beat several other science fiction and fantasy series to receive a special Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series". The runners-up for the award were the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Future History series by Robert A. Heinlein, the Lensman series by Edward E. Smith and The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien.[25] 
                                    The Foundation series was the only series so honored until the establishment of the "Best Series" category in 2017. 
                                    Asimov himself wrote that he assumed the one-time award had been created to honor The Lord of the Rings, and he was amazed when his work won.[26]

                                Science fiction parodies, such as Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Harry Harrison's Bill, the Galactic Hero, often display clear Foundation influences.

                                The 1957 short story "Marius", which set off Poul Anderson's early future history, the Psychotechnic League, clearly shows the influence of Asimov's Foundation—though moved from the far future of a collapsing Galactic Empire to a near future of a late 20th Century Earth struggling to recover from the devastation of a nuclear Third World War.

                                During the 2006–2007 Marvel Comics Civil War crossover storyline, in Fantastic Four #542 Mister Fantastic revealed his own attempt to develop psychohistory, saying he was inspired after reading the Foundation series.
