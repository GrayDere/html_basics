                The first four stories were collected, along with a new introductory story, and published by Gnome Press in 1951 as Foundation. <p>
                The later stories were published in pairs by Gnome as <em>Foundation and Empire (1952)</em> and <em>Foundation (1953)</em>, 
                resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.</p>
            </strong>

            <p>The early stories were inspired by Edward Gibbon's <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em>.<p>
                The plot of the series focuses on the growth and reach of the Foundation, against a backdrop of the "decline and fall of the Galactic Empire."<p> 
                The themes of Asimov's stories were also influenced by the political tendency in science fiction fandom, 
                associated with the Futurians, known as Michelism.</p>
                
            <p>The focus of the books is the trends through which a civilization might progress, specifically seeking to analyze their progress, using history as a precedent.<p> 
                Although many science fiction novels such as Nineteen Eighty-Four or Fahrenheit 451 do this, their focus is upon how current trends in society might come to fruition and they act as a moral allegory of the modern world.<p>The Foundation series, on the other hand,
                 looks at the trends in a wider scope, dealing with societal evolution and adaptation rather than the human and cultural qualities at one point in time.

                    <p> Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which gives the events in the story a sense of rational fatalism, leaves little room for moralization.
