            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <h4>This is about The Foundation Trilogy</h4>

            <strong>
                <p>
                The first four stories were collected, along with a new introductory story, and published by Gnome Press in 1951 as Foundation. <p>
                The later stories were published in pairs by Gnome as <em>Foundation and Empire (1952)</em> and <em>Foundation (1953)</em>, </p>
                <p>resulting in the "Foundation Trilogy", as the series is still known.[6]</p>

            <p>If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph element, which will add a newline after each of our paragraphs. 
             A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a paragraph tag.
                    <p> Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.
